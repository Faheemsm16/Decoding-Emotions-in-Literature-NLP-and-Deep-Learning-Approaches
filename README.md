# Decoding Emotions in Literature  
**NLP and Deep Learning Approaches for Literary Emotion Detection**

## Overview
This project presents a novel framework for detecting **fine-grained emotions** in literary texts using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning**. Leveraging **DistilBERT** fine-tuned on the **GoEmotions dataset**, the system identifies nuanced emotional patterns in narratives and visualizes them using **heatmaps** and **emotion evolution graphs**.

> Unlike traditional sentiment analysis, this approach focuses on understanding complex, overlapping emotions in literature such as **remorse**, **caring**, **joy**, and **realization**.

---

## Objectives
- Detect fine-grained emotions in literary texts.
- Compare transformer-based models vs. lexicon-based methods.
- Visualize emotion transitions using heatmaps and line graphs.
- Enable real-time and interpretable emotion profiling in literature.

## Methodology

### 1. Preprocessing
- **Tokenization** using DistilBERT tokenizer
- **Stopword removal** (NLTK)
- **Sliding window segmentation**: 20-word windows with 50% overlap

### 2. Emotion Classification
- Multi-label classification using **DistilBERT**
- Baseline comparison using **NRC Emotion Lexicon**

### 3. Visualization
- **Emotion evolution graphs** (line plots)
- **Emotion heatmaps** for segment-level intensity

---

## Results
- **Transformer-based models** outperform lexicon-based methods on subtle, figurative language.
- **Multi-label classification** effectively captures overlapping emotions.
- **Sliding window segmentation** enhances emotional transition tracking.

## Challenges
- Figurative and symbolic language (e.g., metaphors)
- Emotion co-occurrence and ambiguity
- Sarcasm and irony detection
- Limited performance on archaic or poetic expressions

---

## Future Work
- Fine-tuning on large-scale literary corpora
- Domain-specific emotion lexicons
- Incorporation of **audiobook-based multimodal cues**
- Interactive emotion-based reading tools
